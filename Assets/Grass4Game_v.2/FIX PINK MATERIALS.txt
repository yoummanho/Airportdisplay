If you're seeing pink materials you're probably using the wrong pipeline!
You need to use this package in a HD Render Pipeline (HDRP), so you have to create a new project with the HDRP template or you can convert your existing project into it from Package Manager.
After that, if you're still seeing pink materials you will need to reimport all the package, clicking the right button on the Project tab and selecting the option "Reimport All".
This should be enough to fix the problem, but if it isn't please contact us from the Asset Store page.
